	<p>These models and renderings were made for a geometric modeling class I took in which we iteratively designed pavillions. The model above features a shell-inspired form with a stage, and benches. The models on the right are another response to the same assignment with mixed materials and a different interpretation of shells.</p>

	<p> As a resident of the Boston/Cambridge area, I've been to many events at our local outdoor auditorium, the Hatch Shell. Shells as outdoor spaces, to me, are interesting for their acoustic benefits but also for their organic forms. Shells can be incredibly complex, geometric and almost appear to be computationally generated for their extreme neatness and repetition. I wanted to take advantage of my ability, as a designer, to incorporate computational methods into my designs and create different objects inspired by shells.</p>

	<p>Bucket chairs are a time honored tradition of furniture design. I approached them as an opportunity to practice modeling a simple form that could be applicable to other designs of mine (these are referenced in the pavillion in the splash image of this page). These chair models are inspired by natural forms of the body. This is a response to the work of Neri Oxman, who creates bio-inspired design. The creases in the seats are made to fit with the human body rather than resist it, and create a more comfortable and personalized experience. These are a few different renderings I made of that model.

	<p>There's a lot more left to come in this section - I'd like to work more on storytelling and more open ended projects that aren't based on precendents as heavily. This work also lets me work with many different colors, texture and materials that I am not used to applying to modeling for academic use. These models were generated for independent projects - from character modeling to 3D printing.</p>
