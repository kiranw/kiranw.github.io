				<p>While reading Lamport's Paxos and Byzantine Generals Problem papers
				we were struck by how Lamport relates a system design to a human
				analogy. However, what if the inverse approach was applied to designing
				a system? In this project, we attempt to extract parts of the
				Westminster System to create a distributed and hierarchical consensus
				and leader election algorithm. </p>
				<p>While governments predate distributed systems research by millennia,
				the development of distributed systems has happened separately, and
				thus has potentially disregarded ideas and lessons therein. Even in
				"The Part-Time Parliament", it is clear that Lamport constructs a
				fictional government to fit a distributed systems scenario, and not the
				other way round.</p>
				<p>Whether human analogies incept the ideas, or the ideas beget
				analogies we were interested to see what could be gained from applying
				human systems to distributed systems. It is clear that there are
				striking parallels between the design of distributed systems and the
				construction of government systems. Consensus and leader election are
				long standing requirements of many governments today.</p>
				<p>We start with the Westminster System since it has several
				requirements that are clearly structured, and the system operates
				almost like an interface that has been extended and customized by
				several other governments for various purposes (a lot of the Eastern
				Bloc, India, Australia, Canada, Japan).</p>
				<p>Next, we observe each part of the Westminster System to see which
				parts can be be adapted and which parts seem repetitive, inapplicable
				or superfluous. With this subset, we attempt to create a consensus
				algorithm that is close to the spirit of the original system.</p>
				<p>Finally we make comparisons to existing consensus algorithms and
				draw some conclusions.</p>

			<div class="section-header">Related Work</div>
			<br>
			<p>Aside from the Lamport paper, trying to find previous work in the area
			drawing inspiration from governments for distributed systems proved to be
			challenging. However, widening our scope a bit, we were able to find some
			interesting papers in related subjects that offer some insights and
			support for our way of thinking.</p>

			<p>One paper by Imamichi talks about "Distributed Information Systems and
			Human Organization", which seemed promising but ended up being about the
			effect of moving from centralized to distributed computer systems on
			human organizations, and not about distributed systems-inspired human
			organizations. Nonetheless the implication was that the system that
			humans use to communicate and coordinate with each other has an effect on
			how they conduct their daily business, which was promising.</p>

			<p>Another paper by Axtell ties the idea of agent-based modelling in
			Economics with Distributed Computing. This is a highly theoretical,
			unfocused and sprawling paper that incorporates many ideas, and
			criticizes the mathematical modelling approaches at the time for making
			overly simplified assumptions of human systems. It likens human agents in
			an economic system to "concurrent processes with heterogeneous
			information". Interestingly, it argues that "real societies are
			asynchronous", and then goes on to list the effects of this, most of
			which are familiar to us from a distributed systems context. It also
			portrays humans as agents having to constantly deal with incomplete and
			out of date information and making best-effort decisions based on that.
			If anything, this paper agrees with our hunch that humans deal with
			distributed systems problems all the time, and provides further
			justification for our investigation.</p>

			<p>One of the citations for this paper, by Huberman and Hogg from Xerox
			PARC, likens computer networks to market economies ("coordinating
			asynchronous operations in the face of imperfect knowledge"), which is an
			encouraging sign that we're looking at something interesting. However the
			paper itself mostly deals with the allocation of resources and less about
			consensus. One interesting point is that it warns about how humans are
			more complex and slower than machines on a network, and that while in
			distributed systems it's a nice approach to try to eliminate these
			problems systematically (deploy uniform software on homogeneous machines,
			build networks with ordering guarantees, etc), in the case of humans
			we're often stuck with the eccentricities that come with them and need to
			deal with them directly.</p>

			<p>Finally, the field of Human Based Computation offers some interesting
			insights. Systems like CAPTCHAs, Collaborative Filtering systems (like
			Netflix or Yelp) can all be thought of as distributed consensus systems.
			Many users voting 0 to 5 stars on a TV show over time is essentially a
			distributed and asynchronous consensus process with no time limit. In
			this field, incentive to participate is a big consideration -  the
			assumption being that by default people might not want to participate and
			they have to be attracted with some benefit. For us, it's the opposite -
			in a legislative system, the benefits are often quite clear to the
			participants, and it's rather a problem of attracting the right kind of
			participant, which does not really affect how our model works.</p>

			<div class="section-header">What is the Westminster System?</div>
			<br>
			<p>
			The Westminster System is a parliamentary system of government first
			developed in the United Kingdom, rooted in the 11th century but
			developing into the system we recognize in the 17th century. It was later
			adopted widely around the world and is one of the earliest iterations of
			a <b>modern</b> parliamentary model that has withstood the test of time,
			making it a reasonable choice to study as an archetypal example of a real
			world government consensus system.
			</p>
			<p>
			Important characteristics of the Westminster System are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A <i>Monarch</i> who is the head of the entire state.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <i>Prime Minister</i> who is the head of the executive branch.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <i>House of Commons</i> and a <i>House of Lords</i> which together
					form a bicameral legislative branch. Unicameral variants exist, but
					are less common, like Israel and New Zealand.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">The Monarch</strong><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Terms are often unelected, lifelong and hereditary</li>
				<li>Is not involved in the day to day operation of government</li>
				<li>Makes appointments based on the advice of the House and Prime Minister</li>
				<li>Has limited reserve powers (granting pardons, delaying legislation,
					dismissing a prime minister) that can be exercised only under
					exceptional circumstances</li>
				<li>In some "disintermediated" countries like Ireland and Israel, the
					head of state is purely ceremonial and performs no function</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">The Prime Minister</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Usually the leader of the party with the most elected seats in the
					House of Commons, customarily appointed by the Monarch</li>
				<li>Selects a cabinet of advisors to form and lead the executive branch</li>
				<li>Is "Primus inter pares": First among equals, meaning officially the
					PM has the same powers as the Cabinet and must consult with the
					Cabinet for all decisions, but informally is accorded additional
					respect, finalizes all decisions, etc.</li>
				<li>Can be forced to resign if they lose a vote of confidence in the House of Commons</li>
				<li>Terms are for five years with no term limit</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">The House of Commons</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Represent different constituencies across the country</li>
				<li>Convene regularly to suggest, discuss, and agree upon bills that define new laws</li>
				<li>One representative maps to one constituency, the borders of which
					are often decided by independent Boundary Commissions</li>
				<li>In the UK, this is the lower house with 650 seats</li>
				<li>Can reject a motion of confidence to force resignation by the Prime Minister</li>
				<li>A Speaker and Opposition Leader are elected</li>
				<li>Terms are for five years with no term limit, or end when Parliament dissolves</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">The House of Lords</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Members are considered to be domain experts</li>
				<li>Convene regularly to scrutinize bills passed by the House of Commons</li>
				<li>Most members are appointed, some are elected</li>
				<li>In the UK, total number of members is not fixed (currently 781)</li>
				<li>Members usually come from the House of Commons</li>
				<li>Cannot prevent bills from being passed into law, but can force the Commons to reconsider votes and delay a process</li>
				<li>Terms are 15 years, capped at 1 term for elected members, except for some special members who are appointed for life.</li>

	<div id="keep" class="section row">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<div class="section-header">What's worth keeping?</div><br/>

			<p>
			The above description is an extremely reductive version of the real
			system as implemented. The first thing that struck us after researching
			the Westminster System is just how complicated it is, with many tedious
			details, exceptions and special cases along with many practices that are
			seemingly there only for historical reasons. So we included only the
			salient points.
			
			From what remains, it is worth highlighting a few key characteristics we
			want to embrace, and others we would like to omit before we describe the
			system in full.

			</p>

				<p>One notable detail about how the actual Westminster System works is
					that the elected representatives represent different geographical
					regions. This reminded us of global, federated networks of computers
					with layers of structure (e.g. in-datacenter versus across the
					world), so we chose that as the scenario to build towards.
				</p>

				<p>A Monarch will not be included in this system because we
				struggled to find a purpose for this mostly ceremonial role. Also in
				any distributed system, it is difficult to imagine a system in which
				any machine is as permanent as a Monarch, that is not selected or
				renewed by consensus.
				</p>

				<p>In the Westminster System, The House of Commons serves a different,
					shorter cycle than the House of Lords. This is an interesting idea,
					because it allows for two different classes of members that have
					staggered leases, which might eliminate a situation where everyone
					voting or changing at the same time causes problems. The "thundering
					herd problem" is one example where every node in a system doing
					things simultaneously causes undesirable spikes in resource usage
					resources and bandwidth problems.

					The House of Lords can best represent local changes to a network if
					machines are added and dropped - this form of representation will be
					most responsive. However, choosing the representatives of a large
					scale system too often may delay the speed of decision making. This
					makes the bicameral structure favorable, where the House of Lords is
					less responsive but more stable over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Term limits are also an interesting idea - it prevents members of the
					system from becoming "special", which would imply an over-reliance on
					those members which might cause reliability issues.

					It is a truism in reliable systems that things that happen rarely are
					error-prone because they end up being not well-tested in the real
					world. For example, failover in traditional data systems is something
					that systems administrators fear. Netflix's Chaos Monkey is an
					interesting approach to this problem: by inducing failure on purpose,
					they make failover a routine scenario rather than an exceptional one.

					Term limits are a similar idea: nodes have to swap duties after a
					certain period of time, so that swapping duties becomes routine.

					Although term limits are worth integrating into the system, we did
					not include the proportion of each as it currently exists in the
					Parliament. The House of Lords in reality is larger than the House of
					Commons, but in this system, but House of Lords will be significantly
					smaller.
				</p>
				<p> A vote of confidence regulates the term of the Prime Minster. These
				will be regularly initiated, and can serve to either terminate or renew
				the lease of a serving prime minister, which, in this case, is
				automatically enduring unless a Vote of No Confidence occurs. </p>
				<p>There is a judiciary in the Westminster System whose job it is to
				interpret and apply the laws that the legislative branch agrees upon.
				Since in our case "laws" are merely values in a distributed system,
				there isn't really anything to interpret and apply.
				</p>

	<div class="row section">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<div class="section-header">System Components</div>
			<br>
			<p> We can now describe our Westminster-inspired system. </p>

			<strong class="sub-heading">Network Structure</strong><br><br>
			<p>We assume a network in which there are geographically distributed machines across a broad scale. If not
				geographically distributed, this system is modeled after machines that represent diverse services,
				products or operations such that inclusion of different "districts" or zones is important. In this way,
				the use of constituencies to partition the network into smaller districts for hierarchical voting makes sense.
				If some decisions to be made are localized to specific districts, then a vote can occur internally, without
				continuing to deeper levels of the hierarchy before reaching an answer. This can improve efficiency and availability
				in the larger system, and better utilize the local system.</p>

			<p>Such an assumption requires tools to partition the network into
			districts. If we wanted to do this automatically, a starting point could
			be algorithms (dubbed "community detection") that use different
			heuristics to separate topologies into smaller clusters:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The classic example, the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, attempts to
					partition a graph into sections while minimizing the number of
					connections needed between each section (network modularity). This
					could perhaps be employed in situations where the network topology is
					a limiting factor, which is often.
				</li>
				<li>There are also modern variants such as Newman's "fast" algorithm
					which uses greedy optimization to minimize the modularity metric and
					scales better to larger networks.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally there are variants like Facebook's graph partitioning
					algorithm, which are graph-parallel, meaning it does not need global
					information and can be performed solely with node to node
					communication.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			A simpler and perhaps more practical scenario is that geographic or
			function based boundaries are already apparent to the operators and which
			district each node belongs to and an arbitrary leader for that district
			is manually bootstrapped into the system as it is started. After that,
			the system can determine things automatically.
			</p>

			<strong class="sub-heading">Properties of the members</strong><br><br>
			<p>
			We don't make any special assumptions regarding the reliability of
			machines: we assume the system is composed of heterogeneous commodity
			machines. This reflects the situation in the real world, and makes sense
			from a distributed systems point of view as it is impractical to try to
			build specialized hardware to eliminate failure at a large scale.
			</p>

			<p>
			One way that individual reliability is maintained in real parliamentary
			systems is a reputation system: members who do bad things eventually are
			recognized as being bad.

			In this vein, we can include a mechanism where machines maintain
			reputation values for other machines which are based on desirable
			heuristics such as network uptime (similar to seniority), speed of
			response, quality of response, etc. These can be combined into a single
			"reputation" metric. These perhaps need not be consistent across
			different machines: different machines may care about different
			properties.
			
			Machines can these use these reputation metrics when deciding who to vote
			for in higher positions. </p>

			<strong class="sub-heading">Relationships Between The Members</strong><br><br>
			<p>
			After machines are organized into districts, districts internally elect
			its representative for the house of commons. Then a group of
			representatives 

			The purpose of this tiering can be twofold:
			</p>

			<p> First, a federated system with many subsystems can have certain
			information that needs to only be shared with a local group of nodes,
			while others which concern everyone in the system. This might be due to
			geographical distance, or due to the fact that specific nodes perform
			specific functions that don't concern other nodes. Consensus over global
			values require more and longer communication, which makes them more
			expensive in terms of time and bandwidth usage. So mandating global
			consensus for every bit of data is inefficient. A tiered system allows
			the members to avoid this inefficiency whenever possible.
			</p>

			<p>
			Second, it separates internal and external communication. This helps
			because flowing all non-local requests through a single node allows for
			efficiency improvements such as batching messages.

			This also helps with scaling: in a system where every node communicates
			with every other node, the cost of communication is n squared. Dividing
			up and grouping the nodes based on task or geography helps reduce this
			effect at the global level.
			</p>

			<strong class="sub-heading">House of Commons</strong><br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Members are winners of district elections</li>
				<li>Relay requests from district to house if valid</li>
				<li>Collect requests that cannot be handled without consensus (write) until next Parliament meeting</li>
				<li>Load balancer for reads that can be managed at the district level (do not pass operation up hierarchy)</li>
				<li>Re-elect at regular interval, shortest lease of all positions</li>
				<li>Serve as the most responsive body to local district changes in network</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="section-header">The District Level System</div>
			<Br>
			<br>
			<div class="sub-heading">A Toy Model</div>
			<p>In this visualization, we present a local district voting system. The system starts with Node 0 as its
			elected local leader. The first panel (center) represents the scoring metrics updating, establishing a reputation
			on the machines. The top scoring machine is offered a ballot position in the next election, and the current
			leader will broadcast to all nodes in the district that an election is occuring. Constituent nodes must
			respond within a fixed amount of time for their vote to count, and the leader announces the newly elected leader
				by broadcasting to all nodes. A log of the internal system actions is maintained on the right side.</p>

			<p>The visualization features 3 specific operations. The first, in greater detail is the local election
			protocol. At a regular interval, the current leader (based on its own internal time) will initiate an election.
			This happens when the leader node (shown in blue) broadcasts a message to all nodes in the district. This model currently
			assumes all nodes in a district are completely connected. This is not a requirement, however, as messages
			can be relayed through other connected nodes. Once nodes receive the election notification, they submit a
			ballot within a certain period of time. The ballot confirms that the node will vote for the top performing
			node in the district, based on its reputation metrics. Those metrics are displayed at the top of the middle
			panel, in a dictionary. Once the leader (the district representative) receives and processes votes, it will
			broadcast the result, and leaders will transition. The transition includes the transfer of a ledger of
			pending requests from the current leader to the new leader, if the leader is changing.</p>

			<p>The reputation scores are maintained in a dictionary, displayed in the middle panel. In our implementation,
			reputation is randomly selected from a distribution, and the scores are assigned the same way for the current
			leader and for the rest of the nodes in the district. However, we imagine that in a real system, a longer
			tenure may translate to a better score, and heuristics for this should be specifically selected for the
			needs of the design of that system.</p>

			<p>The next operation is a read request. One benefit of the federated consensus model is that it can
			dramatically reduce the size of a network based on the work being done. In this case, reads are handled
			by their district representatives (House of Commons members for each constituency). Because they are
			not mutating anything, a district representative can simply collect requests, and operate as an intermediate
			layer between district nodes and data stores. Districts, by this nature, will also handle their own caches.
			This can be particularly useful if the network is zoned into districts based on the behaviors they
			exhibit. This leads to caches that may better serve the needs of a district than a more generic cache. </p>

			<p>The final operation is a write request. A randomly selected node in the district sends a request to the
				current leader. This request is then handled, and either added to a ledger or discarded if it conflicts
				with another request already in the system (an example of this is account creation). The requests that
				do remain are appended to the Write Queue, which is displayed in the center panel. Write queues are
				managed at the district level, and are only emptied during Parliamentary Sessions. The action on
				district write queues is better explained in the visualization following this one.

			<p>This model has some strengths and weaknesses, and of course is a simplification of the nuances of a real
			implementation of such a system. However, where there are details that need to be filled in, we have abstracted
			components that represent the higher level system design. One key take away from this system is that it
			handles requests differently, depending on what they are, and that district representatives in the House
			of Commons can serve as load balancers for requests.</p>

			<div class="section-header">The House of Commons</div>
			<Br>
			<br>
			<div class="sub-heading">A Toy Model</div>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading"></strong><br>
			<p>In this visualization, we cover the interactions between districts, between districts and the House,
				and internally in the house. The top section (directly below here) displays an example of a network
				divided into 12 districts. Each district has been partitioned based on some heuristic (we discuss this
				in greater detail in the analysis section). Within each district is a graph of the nodes included, a
				leader which has been highlighted in blue, and a write queue which has aggregated locally. The elements
				displayed in each of the 12 containers here are carried over from the previous model of a district's
				interactions. The leader in blue is elected the same way it was shown in the previous visualization, but
				the process is not shown in full detail here, because of scale.
			</p>

			<p>
				Below the districts is the House of Commons, featuring one representative per district. One of these
				members is also the Prime Minister of the network. Each node in the House is labelled with
				[districtId].[memberId]. The Prime Minister is shown in blue, and in our representation, the network
				of the House of Commons is also fully connected, though as long as messages can reach all nodes from
				all other nodes in the House, such a model could work.
			</p>

			<p>In the middle panel, we display another dictionary containing reputation scores for each district in the
				House. These scores are tied to the weighed and combined performance of the district at large, and
				its selected representative. Below the reputation board is another write queue. This one is maintained
				at the House level. We discuss this in further detail in the "Parliament Session" below.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first operation we provide here is a Parliament Session. As pointed out in the previous section,
				districts collect write queues locally until a Parliament Session is called by the PM, at a regular
				interval. The Prime Minister initiates the meeting, by sending a request to each House member, one at a
				time. The members then return to the Prime Minister with their write requests, from the write queues
				they maintain for their districts. The Prime Minister sends out ballots in batches from those queues
				to all members of the House for voting. Once received, House members submit their votes in batches and
				the Prime Minister broadcasts the result. The PM then reviews the votes, and either can discard a request,
				process a request directly, or append it to the House ledger to pass on to the Lords for another
				round of voting to establish consensus when critical. Then, the Prime Minister follows by sending the
				next district a request for its queue. It performs this operation in round robin style, where each
				district is given a time slot based on its districtId.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next operation is a Vote of Confidence. This can either be initiated by a node in the House upon
				request, or at a regular interval based on the lease of a prime minister. The Vote proceeds by the
				leader initiating a broadcast to the house for preserving its seat. The members receive the request,
				submit a vote (based on a performance heuristic, ie. scoreboard), and the prime minister processes
				this. Finally, if more than 50% of members approve, the prime minister stays. Otherwise, there is a
				transition of leadership to the highest reputation member of the House.
			</p>

			<p>
				The final operation is the relection of members of the house. Each district staggers its votes, and
				will carry out the voting procedure outlined in the first visualization. As those districts update their
				leaders, they are updated in the house voting and will resume carrying out votes that in progress, if
				a parliament meeting was called or if the leader node failed. The node serving as prime minister is not
				re-elected during this time. Instead, if the prime minister fails a vote of confidence, the district
				will re-elect their representative and a new PM is selecting in the interim.

				<!--talk about these points:
				- this is a weaker system for small scale networks where a hierarchy does not make sense
				- need to select the zoning algorithm for districts based on the behavior observed in the network
				- if you can naturally balance loads at district levels, this can reduce load on the system as a whole when
				only district-level consensus is needed for some data
				- moves critical requests up a hierarchy - model is good for balancing systems where there are diffrent
				requirements for consistency at the same time (some things are critical, others are local)
				- several leader elections are required - we stagger ours the same way a company would during a failover
