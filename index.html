				<p>We were struck by Lamport's Paxos and Byzantine Generals Problem papers. In both of these, Lamport relates
					a system design to a human analogy to explain how such a system would look in a mechanism that is relatable.
					However, what if the inverse approach was applied to designing a system? In this project, we attempt to extract
					parts of the Westminster System to create a distributed, hierarchical conensus and leader election algorithm.
				</p>
				<p>Whether human analogies incept the ideas, or the ideas beget analogies we were interested to see what
					could be gained from applying human systems to distributed systems. It is clear that there are
					striking parallels between the design of distributed systems and the construction of government
					systems. Consensus and leader election are long standing requirements of many governments today.
				</p>
				<p>We start with the Westminster System since it has several requirements that are clearly structured, and
					the system operates almost like an interface that has been extended and customized by several other
					governments for various purposes (a lot of the Eastern Bloc, India, Australia, Canada, Japan).

				<li>Members are considered to be domain experts</li>
				<li>Most members are appointed, some are elected</li>
				<li>Total number of members is not fixed (currently 781)</li>
				<li>Members usually come from the House of Commons</li>
				<li>Scrutinize bills passed by the House of Commons</li>
				<li>Cannot prevent bills from being passed into law, but can force the Commons to reconsider votes and delay a process</li>
				<li>Terms are 15 years</li>
				<li>Members are capped at 1 term</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">Monarch</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Makes appointments based on the advice of the House and Prime Minister</li>
				<li>Terms are lifelong and hereditary</li>
				<li>There is no election</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">Prime Minister</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Selects a cabinet of advisors</li>
				<li>Appointed by the Monarch as a person with the confidence of the House of Commons</li>
				<li>"Primus inter pares": First among equals</li>
				<li>Can be forced to resign if they lose a vote of confidence</li>
				<li>Terms are "at her majesty's pleasure"</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<p>This is an extremely reductive representation of only parts of the Parliament system. There is also a judiciary system which
				we will not be exploring in this project, because revision and review of a corpus of data that has already been agreed upon
				occurs in the Parliament in our model system.</p>

			<p>It is worth highlighting a few key characteristics we want to embrace, and others we will not be including in the project.
				The House of Commons serves a shorter cycle than the House of Lords, which allows for staggered voting and different leases.
				This means the House of Lords can best represent local changes to a network if machines are added and dropped - this form
				of representation will be most responsive. However, choosing the representatives of a large scale system that often may
				delay the speed of decision making. This makes the bicameral structure ideal, where the House of Lords is less responsive
				but more stable over time.</p>

			<p>Although the term limits are worth integrating into the system, we did not include the proportion of each
				as it currently exists in the Parliament. The House of Lords in reality is larger than the House of Commons,
				but in this system, but House of Lords will be significantly smaller.</p>

			<p>Apart from the federated model of decision making, we will also be including votes of confidence. These will be regularly
				initiated, and can serve to either terminate or renew the lease of a serving prime minister, which, in this case, is automatically
				enduring unless a Vote of No Confidence occurs.</p>

			<p> Lastly, a Monarch will not be included in this system. In our use case of the Westminster System as a distributed system, it is
			difficult to imagine a system in which any machine is as permanent as a Monarch, that is not selected or renewed by consensus.</p>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">Assumptions about the Underlying System Structure</strong><br><br>
			<strong>Network Structure</strong><br>
			<p>We assume a network in which there are geographically distributed machines across a broad scale. If not
				geographically distributed, this system is modelled after machines that represent diverse services,
				products or operations such that inclusion of different "districts" or zones is important. In this way,
				the use of constituencies to partition the network into smaller districts for hierarchical voting makes sense.
				If some decisions to be made are localized to specific districts, then a vote can occur internally, without
				continuing to deeper levels of the hierarchy before reaching an answer. This can improve efficiency and availability
				in the larger system, and better utilize the local system.</p>

			<p>Such an assumption requires tools to partition networks. Several
			algorithms (dubbed "community detection") already exist that use
			different heuristics to separate topologies into smaller clusters which
			we will consider to be districts:

			<ul>
				<li>The classic example, the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, attempts to
					partition a graph into sections while minimizing the number of
					connections needed between each section (network modularity). This
					could perhaps be employed in situations where the network topology is
					a limiting factor.
				</li>
				<li>There are also modern variants such as Newman's "fast" algorithm
					which uses greedy optimization to minimize the modularity metric and
					scales better to larger networks.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally there are variants like Facebook's graph partitioning
					algorithm, which are graph-parallel, meaning it does not need global
					information and can be performed solely with node to node
					communication.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			<strong>Commodity Machines</strong><br>
			<p>We assume the system is composed of several commodity machines. This practically makes sense, as large
			scale distributed systems do not depend on reliable machines to construct reliable systems. In this system design,
			we handle the addition or removal of machines with shorter leases for local leader terms. This allows
			for local leader elections to be more responsive to changes in local districts. Machines also maintain reputations
			which are based on some heuristic. Machines that have proven more "trustworthiness" score higher reputation
			metrics, which are used to appoint machines to higher serving positions and carry more voting power.</p>

			<strong>Operations Expected</strong><br>
			<p>This system can support local leader election (Commons), the selection of the next layer (Lords), global leader
			election (PM), and standard CRUD operations. Some operations can be handled locally, for example, reads or
			writes for local districts that do not need consensus among the entire system (could be useful for temporary logs).</p>

			In this visualization, we present a local district voting system. The system starts with Node 0 as its
			elected local leader. The first panel (center) represents the scoring metrics updating, establishing a reputation
			on the machines. The top scoring machine is offered a ballot position in the next election, and the current
			leader will broadcast to all nodes in the district that an election is occuring. Constituent nodes must
			respond within a fixed amount of time for their vote to count, and the leader announces the newly elected leader
			by broadcasting to all nodes. A log of the internal system actions is maintained on the right side.

			<div class="section-header">Related Work</div>
			<br>
			<p>Aside from the Lamport paper, trying to find previous work in the area
			of simulating parliaments as distributed systems proved to be
			challenging. However, widening our scope a bit, we were able to find some
			interesting papers in related subjects that offer some insights.</p>

			<p>One paper by Imamichi talks about "Distributed Information Systems and
			Human Organization", which seemed promising but ended up being about the
			effect of moving from centralized to distributed computer systems on
			human organizations, and not about distributed systems-inspired human
			organizations. Nonetheless the implication was that the system that
			humans use to communicate and coordinate with each other has an effect on
			how they conduct their daily business, which was promising.</p>

			<p>Another paper by Axtell ties the idea of agent-based modelling in
			Economics with Distributed Computing. This is a highly theoretical,
			unfocused and sprawling paper that incorporates many ideas, and
			criticizes the mathematical modelling approaches at the time for making
			overly simplified assumptions of human systems. It likens human agents in
			an economic system to "concurrent processes with heterogeneous
			information". Interestingly, it argues that "real societies are
			asynchronous", and then goes on to list the effects of this, most of
			which are familiar to us from a distributed systems context. It also
			portrays humans as agents not necessarily solving the problems of
			distributed systems but having to constantly deal with incomplete and out
			of date information and making best-effort decisions based on that. If
			anything, this paper agrees with our hunch that humans deal with
			distributed systems problems all the time, and provides further
			justification for investigating.</p>

			<p>One of the citations for this paper, by Huberman and Hogg from Xerox
			Parc, likens computer networks to market economies ("coordinating
			asynchronous operations in the face of imperfect knowledge"), which is an
			encouraging sign that we're looking at something interesting. However the
			paper itself mostly deals with the allocation of resources and less about
			consensus. One interesting point is that it warns about how humans are
			more complex and slower than machines on a network, and that while in
			distributed systems it's a nice approach to try to eliminate these
			problems systematically (deploy uniform software on homogenous machines,
			build networks with ordering guarantees, etc), in the case of the humans
			we're often stuck with the eccentricities that come with them and need to
			deal with them directly.</p>

			<p>Finally, the field of Human Based Computation offers some interesting
			insights. Systems like CAPTCHAs, Collaborative Filtering systems (like
			Netflix or Yelp) can all be thought of as distributed consensus systems.
			Many users voting 0 to 5 stars on a TV show over time is essentially a
			distributed and asynchronous consensus process with no time limit. In
			this field, incentive to participate is a big consideration -  the
			assumption being that by default people might not want to participate and
			they have to be attracted with some benefit. For us, it's the opposite -
			in a legislative system, the benefits are often quite clear to the
			participants, and it's rather a problem of attracting the right kind of
			participant, which might not really affect how our model works.</p>
