		<p>Afia was the product of our group studio project for the Master in Design Engineering, during the first year Collaborative Design Studio. I worked with a team of 4 - Julian, Kenneth and Janet - and I'd be remiss to not include them here.</p>

		<p>Here's a summarized version of our project (a subset of our final presentation)-</p>
		<p>37 million people in the world have HIV - this number grows on the order of millions, annually. Attrition in testing continues to remain a problem, leading patients who enter the diagnostic pipeline to dropping out of the testing schedule before even getting a final diagnosis. We want to reduce this number by reducing detection time for potential early HIV infections. Even though testing is not to blame for the epidemic, it does play a significant role in awareness, transmission, and patient agency. Current HIV testing may lack sensitivity based on cost, is slow, and requires training, relegating it to expensive procedures often performed in labs. The need for sensitive testing is furthered by the U=U movement (undetectable = untransmittable), recently backed by the CDC. Given our market, regulatory challenges and technical requirements, a good solution is (1) simple and intuitive, (2) fast, (3) deployable and easy to use on the field, and (4) affordable. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We have created a flow cytometry-based assay that implements microfluidic processes to safely, accurately and quickly count viral load measurements in under 1 mL of blood. The chip will be implemented in concert with a phone accessory with companion app that both fits all standard phone types used in Africa and America and allows both in clinic and at home usage. To circumvent the need to do lab testing, we designed our device with simplicity and disposability in mind. Weâ€™ll cover our research and solution on 4 different scales: (1) the viral scale (technical interactions), (2) the device scale (components), (4) human scale (clinical, user experience), and (5) the systems scale (national rollout).

		<img src="img/afia-23.jpg">
		<p class="label">Because our microfluidic device needs to be made with positive and negative molds, we first created this wafer (a positive mold). It's a little hard to spot, but these wafers have high-precision channels that are slightly elevated above the surface. By pouring PDMS on top of this, the raised surface actually became a negative surface on the PDMS, etching channels into it.</p>
		<img src="img/afia-16.jpg">
		<p class="label">Another critical part of our testing rig was a set up to manage light (which exposes vesicles that contain fluorophores in an excited state). This was functionalyl our way to mark which vesicles contain the virus, after using flow cytometry to form controlled vesicles. The microfluidic device requires inputs from a few channels - one for a prepared sample, two for different FITC fret pair components, and fluorinated oil.</p>
