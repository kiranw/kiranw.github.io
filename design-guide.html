		Versions of this content have been developed during my tenure at Palantir, and this specific presentation was developed for a session I hosted at AIGA's DC Design Week (2021), in a session called "Defense Against the Dark Arts: Design for Civil Liberties and Agency."

	<div class="textbox">
		<p>I've been gathered and developing this content largely during the course of my work at Palantir, where I served as a Privacy and Civil Liberties engineer, spotting potential issues where products could cause harm to civil liberties, privacy and human rights through policy, engineering, and design decisions.

		<p>I developed these contents with product designers in mind, aiming to cover generally, how design can be used intentionally (or unintentionally) to cause harms, while carving out a framework to guide thinking around design's dark patterns. Rooting these case studies in historical defensive design techniques like poka-yoke, and expanding Sasha Costanza-Chock's extensive work around design justice, I offer categories to evaluate design -- across surveillance, misrepresentation, addition, misdirection, manipulation, and friction -- to give designers clear anchors to consider the impacts of their design choices within the contexts of their products/platforms and broader systems.</p>

		<p>I've begun to adapt these contents to a more interactive web version, though it has a long way to go. The static version above is more complete and thorough though (note these materials were designed to be presented rather than distributed & read, so some slides may feel redundant).</p>
